<a style="font-size:32px;"><b>About</b></a><br><br>
<p style="margin-top:0px;">This is Game Review Website, a college project made by James Barry, Enrique Fernandez, and James Luo for Julianne Schutfort's CS340 (Introduction to Databases) at Oregon State University in Fall 2017. Looking over the website, you may think to yourself "isn't this just MetaCritic?" If you thought that, good job. You're right.<br>You can make an account and leave reviews here. Critic reviews are maintained by the website admins. The selection of games is pretty small because we just built it large enough to demonstrate PHP and SQL for the project.<br>
Please note that, unlike most websites, usernames here are actually case sensitive. Passwords are encrypted, but we can't guarantee database security because our university manages it, so please don't use any passwords you typically use.</p>

    <br>
        <a style="margin-left: 40px">Turns out people can just write whatever they want and it doesn't matter.</a>
